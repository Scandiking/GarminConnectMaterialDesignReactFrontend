# Arbeidskrav 1/2: React Component Development and Demo  

This is a solution to an assignment delegated in the course APP2000. The assignment is as quoted:

> ### Objective  
> This assignment ensures that each team member develops foundational skills in React by creating individual components and presenting their functionality.  
>
> ### Instructions  
> 1. Develop Individual Components  
>   - Each team member should design and code 4-5 React components related to the team project (e.g., a "MenuItem" component for displaying restaurant items or a "SearchBar" for filtering options).  
>   - Components should be functional but do not need to connect to the overall project or backend at this stage.  
> 2. Usage demo  
>   - Prepare a short demo showcasing the usage and structure of your components. Take screenshots and save them in a document for submission.
>   - The demo should include:
>     - A brief explanation of each component's purpose.
>     - A walktrough of the props, state, and any logic implemented within the component.
> 3. Submission guidelines  
>   - Submit your component files along with a brief document that explains their intended functionality, props, and any challenged you faced. (All in a .zip file.)  
>   - Each team member's submission should be individual and cover their specific contributions.  
> ### Evaluation  
> This assignment focuses on individual React proficiency, component structure, and clarity of explanation during the demo.
